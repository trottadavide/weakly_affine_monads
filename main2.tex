\section{Introduction}



For context:
\begin{myproposition}\label{assoc_group}
 A monoid $(M,m,e)$ is a group if and only if the associativity square
 \begin{equation}\label{assoc}
  \begin{tikzcd}
   M \times M \times M \ar{d}{\id\times m} \ar{r}{m\times\id} & M\times M \ar{d}{m} \\
   M\times M \ar{r}{m} & M
  \end{tikzcd}
 \end{equation}
 is a pullback.
\end{myproposition}
The same can be said more generally for a monoid object in a cartesian monoidal category.
\begin{proof}
 The square~\eqref{assoc} is a pullback, both of sets and of groups, if and only if given $a,g,h,c\in M$ such that $ag=hc$, there exists a unique $b\in M$ such that $g=bc$ and $h=ab$.
 First, suppose that $g$ is a group. The only possible choice of $b$ is 
 \[
  b = a^{-1}h = gc^{-1},
 \]
 which is unique by uniqueness of inverses. 
 
 Conversely, suppose that \eqref{assoc} is a pullback. We can set $g,h=e$ and $c=a$ so that $ae=ea=a$. 
 Instantiating the pullback property, there is a unique $b$ such that $ab=e$ and $ba=e$, that is, $b=a^{-1}$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{GS and Markov categories}


\begin{definition}\label{monadM}
 Let $X$ be a set. Denote by $MX$ the set of \emph{finitely supported measures on $X$}, i.e.~functions $m:X\to[0,\infty)$ which are zero for all but a finite number of $x\in X$. 
 Given a function $f:X\to Y$, denote by $Mf:MX\to MY$ the function sending $m\in MX$ to the assignment
 \[
  f_*m : y \mapsto \sum_{x\in f^{-1(y)}} p(x) .
 \]
 This way $M$ is a functor, and even a monad with the following unit and multiplication maps.
 \[
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=0]
   X \ar{r}{\delta} & MX \\
   x \ar[mapsto]{r} & \delta_x ,
  \end{tikzcd}
  \qquad
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=0]
   MMX \ar{r}{E} & MX \\
   \xi \ar[mapsto]{r} & E\xi ,
  \end{tikzcd}
 \]
 where 
 \[
  \delta_x(x') = \begin{cases}
                  1 & x=x' ; \\
                  0 & x\ne x',
                 \end{cases}
 \qquad 
 E\xi(x) = \sum_{m\in MX} \xi(m)\,m(x) .
 \]
 Call $M$ the \emph{measure monad} on $\Set.$

 Denote also by $DX\subseteq MX$ the subset of \emph{probability measures}, i.e. those finitely supported $p:X\to[0,\infty)$ such that
 \[
  \sum_{x\in X} p(x) = 1 .
 \]
 $D$ forms a submonad of $M$ called the \emph{distribution monad}.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
 Every cartesian monoidal category is canonically a GS category with the copy and discard maps given by the diagonal and the terminal maps.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
 The following conditions are equivalent for a GS category $\mC$:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $\mC$ is cartesian monoidal;
  \item Every morphism is copyable and discardable;
  \item The copy and discard maps are natural.
 \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}\label{monoidalgs}
 Let $T$ be a monoidal (equivalently, commutative) monad on a cartesian monoidal category $\mD$. 
 Then $\mathrm{Kl}(T)$ is canonically a GS category with copy and discard structure induced by those of $\mD$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
 A GS category is called \emph{Markov} if any (hence all) of the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item The monoidal unit is terminal;
  \item The discard map is natural;
  \item Every morphism is discardable.
 \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
 A monad $T$ on a cartesian monoidal category is called \emph{affine} if $T1\cong 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{affinemarkov}
 In the hypotheses of \Cref{monoidalgs}, we have that $\mathrm{Kl}(T)$ is Markov if and only if $T$ is affine.
\end{proposition}


In this work we want to introduce an intermediate level between GS and Markov, which we call \emph{weakly Markov}, and its corresponding notion for monads, which we call \emph{weakly affine}. 


\section{Weakly Markov categories and weakly affine monads}

\subsection{The monoid of effects}\label{monoids}

In a GS category $\mC$ we call a \emph{state} a morphism from the monoidal unit $p:I\to X$, and \emph{effect} or \emph{co-state} a morphism to the monoidal unit $a:X\to I$. We represent them as triangles as follows.
 \ctikzfig{state-costate}

Effects, i.e.~elements of the set $\mC(X,I)$, form canonically a commutative monoid as follows: the monoidal unit is the discard map $X\to I$, and given $a,b:X\to I$, their product $ab$ is given by copying, as follows.
\ctikzfig{ptwise-product}
If a morphism $f:X\to Y$ is copyable and discardable, precomposition with $f$ induces a morphism of monoids $\mC(Y,I)\to\mC(X,I)$. 

Let's now consider the case where the GS structure comes from a commutative monad on a cartesian monoidal category $\mD$. 
In this case, the monoid structure of Kleisli morphisms $X\to 1$ comes from the following canonical internal monoid structure of $T1$ in $\mD$, given by 
 \[
 \begin{tikzcd}
  1 \ar{r}{\eta} & T1 ,
 \end{tikzcd}
 \qquad
 \begin{tikzcd}
  T1 \times T1 \ar{r}{c} & T(1\times 1) \ar{r}{\cong} & T1 .
 \end{tikzcd}
 \]
 
 For example, for the monad of measures $M$, we have that $M1=[0,\infty)$ with its usual multiplication.
 
 The monoid structure of Kleisli morphisms $X\to 1$ is now given as follows. The unit is given by
 \[
 \begin{tikzcd}
  X \ar{r}{!} & 1 \ar{r}{\eta} & T1 ,
 \end{tikzcd}
 \]
 and the multiplication of the morphisms $f^\sharp,g^\sharp:X\to T1$ is
 \[
 \begin{tikzcd}
  X \ar{r}{\mathrm{copy}} & X\times X \ar{r}{f^\sharp\times g^\sharp} &
  T1 \times T1 \ar{r}{c} & T(1\times 1) \ar{r}{\cong} & T1 .
 \end{tikzcd}
 \]
 
 For the monad of measures $M$, Kleisli morphisms $X\to 1$ are functions $X\to [0,\infty)$, and their monoidal structure is their pointwise product. 


\subsection{Main definitions}


\begin{mydefinition}
 A GS-category $\mC$ is called \emph{weakly Markov} if for every object $X$, the monoid $\mC(X,I)$ is a group. 
\end{mydefinition}

Every Markov category is weakly Markov: for each $X$, the monoid $\mC(X,I)$ is the trivial group.

Note that the group $\mC(X,I)$ (or monoid, in the general case) acts on the set $\mC(X,Y)$: given $a:X\to I$ and $f:X\to Y$, $a\cdot f$ is given as follows,
\ctikzfig{action}
and the product $(f,g)\mapsto f\cdot g \coloneqq (f\otimes g)\circ\mathrm{copy}_X$ is equivariant for this action in both variables (separately). 

\begin{mydefinition}
 Given two parallel morphisms $f,g:X\to Y$ in a weakly Markov GS-category $\mC$, we say that $f$ and $g$ are \emph{equivalent}, and write $f\sim g$, if they lie in the same orbit for the action of $\mC(X,I)$, i.e.~if there is $a\in \mC(X,I)$ such that $a\cdot f=g$.
 We say they are \emph{uniquely equivalent} if there is a unique $a\in \mC(X,I)$ such that $a\cdot f=g$.
\end{mydefinition}

Let's now look at the Kleisli case.

\begin{mydefinition}
 A commutative monad $T$ on a cartesian monoidal category is called \emph{weakly affine} if $T1$ with its canonical internal monoid structure is a group.
\end{mydefinition}

This choice of terminology is motivated by the following proposition, which can be seen as a weak version of \Cref{affinemarkov}.

\begin{myproposition}\label{weaklyboth}
 Let $\mD$ be a cartesian monoidal category, and let $T$ be a commutative monad on $\mD$. The Kleisli category of $T$ is weakly Markov if and only if $T$ is weakly affine.
\end{myproposition}
\begin{proof}
 First, suppose that $T1$ is an internal group, and denote by $\iota:T1\to T1$ its inversion map. 
 The inverse of the morphism $f^\sharp:X\to T1$ in $\mathrm{Kl}_T(X,1)$ is given by $\iota\circ f$: indeed, the following diagram commutes,
 \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
  X \ar{d}[swap]{f^\sharp} \ar{r}{\mathrm{copy}} & X\times X \ar{d}[swap]{f^\sharp\times f^\sharp} \ar{dr}{f\times(\iota\circ f)} \\
  T1 \ar{d}[swap]{!} \ar{r}{\mathrm{copy}} & T1\times T1 \ar{r}[swap]{\id\times\iota} & T1\times T1 \ar{r}{c} & T(1\times 1) \ar{d}{\cong} \\
  1 \ar{rrr}{\eta} &&& T1
  \end{tikzcd}
 \]
 where the bottom rectangle commutes since $\iota$ is the inversion map for $T1$. The analogous diagram with $\iota\times\id$ in place of $\id\times\iota$ commutes analogously.
 
 Conversely, suppose that for every $X$, the monoid structure on $\mathrm{Kl}_T(X,1)$ has inverses. Then in particular we can take $X=T1$, and the inverse of the Kleisli morphism $\id:T1\to T1$ is an inversion map for $T1$. 
\end{proof}

This result can be seen in terms of the Yoneda embedding, see the details in \Cref{yoneda}.


\subsection{Examples of weakly affine monads} 

Every affine monad is a weakly affine monad. Here are less trivial examples.

\begin{myexample}
    \label{ex:nonzero_measures}
	Let $M^* : \Set \to \Set$ be the monad assigning to every set the set of finitely supported discrete \emph{nonzero}
	measures on $M^*$, or equivalently let $M^*(X)$ for any set $X$ be the set of nonzero finitely supported functions $X \to [0,\infty)$.
	The monad structure is defined in terms of the same formulas as for the monad of measures $M$ (\Cref{monadM}) and the
	components $c_{X,Y}$ are also given by the formation of product measures, or equivalently point-wise products of functions 
	$X \to [0,\infty)$.

	Since $M^* 1 \cong (0,\infty)\ncong 1$, this monad is not affine. However the monoid structure of $(0,\infty)$ induced by $M^*$ is the usual multiplication of positive real numbers, which form a group. Therefore $M^*$ is weakly affine, and its Kleisli category is weakly Markov.

	On the other hand, if the zero measure is included, we have $M1 \cong [0,\infty)$ which is not a group under multiplication, so $M$ is not weakly affine.
\end{myexample}

\begin{myexample}
	\label{ex:abelian_group}
	Let $A$ be a commutative monoid.
	Then the functor $T_A \coloneqq A \times -$ on $\Set$ has a canonical structure of commutative monad, 
	where the lax structure components $c_{X,Y}$ are given by multiplying elements in $A$ while carrying the elements 
	of $X$ and $Y$ along.

	Since $T_A(1) \cong A$, the monad $T_A$ is weakly affine if and only if $A$ is a group, and affine if and only if $A\cong 1$.
\end{myexample}

\begin{myexample}
    \label{ex:nonexample}
    Here is a negative example.
    Consider the free abelian group monad $F$ on $\Set$. Its functor takes a set $X$ and forms the set $FX$ of finite multisets (with repetition, where order does not matter) of elements of $X$ and their formal inverses. 
    We have that $F1\cong \mathbb{Z}$, which is an abelian group under addition. 
    However, the monoid structure on $F1$ induced by the monoidal structure of the monad corresponds to the \emph{multiplication} in $\mathbb{Z}$, which does not have inverses. Therefore $F$ is not weakly affine. 
\end{myexample}


\section{Conditional independence in weakly Markov categories}

Markov categories have a rich theory of conditional independence and independence \cite{fritz2022dseparation}. 
Some of those concepts can be translated and generalized to the setting of weakly Markov categories. 

\begin{mydefinition}\label{defcondind}
 A morphism $f:A\to X_1\otimes\dots\otimes X_n$ in a A GS-category $\mC$ is said to exhibit \emph{conditional independence of the $X_i$ given $A$} if and only if it can be expressed as a product of the following form.
 \ctikzfig{cond-ind-sep}
\end{mydefinition}

Note that this is slightly different from \cite[Definition~6.6]{cho_jacobs_2019}, although it is equivalent for the case of Markov categories.

\begin{myproposition}\label{eqcondind}
 Let $f:A\to X_1\otimes\dots\otimes X_n$ be a morphism in a GS-category $\mC$. Then $f$ exhibits conditional independence of the $X_i$ given $A$ if and only if it is equivalent to the product of all its marginals.
 Moreover, in that case $f$ is \emph{uniquely} equivalent to the product of its marginals.
\end{myproposition}

This generalizes the fact that, in Markov categories, a distribution exhibiting conditional independence is the product of its marginals~\cite[Section~12]{Fritz_2020}.

\begin{proof}
 Denote the marginals of $f$ by $f_1,\dots,f_n$.
 Suppose that $f$ is a product as in \Cref{defcondind}. For each $i=1,\dots,n$, by marginalizing, we get that $f_i$ is equal to the following.
  \ctikzfig{cond-ind-proof} 
 Therefore for each $i$ we have that $f_i\sim g_i$. 
 
 Conversely, suppose that $f$ is equivalent to the product of its marginals, i.e.~that there exists $a:X\to I$ such that $f$ is equal to the following.
 \ctikzfig{cond-ind-proof2}
 One can then choose $g_i=f_i$ for all $i<n$, and $g_n = a\cdot f_n$, so that $f$ is in the form of \Cref{defcondind}.
 Moreover, by marginalizing over all the $X_i$ at once, we see that 
 \ctikzfig{cond-ind-proof3}
 so that $a$ is uniquely determined.
\end{proof} 
 
\begin{myremark}
 For $n=2$, a morphism $f:A\to X\otimes Y$ in a weakly Markov GS-category $\mC$ exhibits conditional independence of $X$ and $Y$ given $A$ 
 if and only if the following equation holds.
 \ctikzfig{cond-ind2} 
\end{myremark}

The next result concerns conditional independence in the Kleisli case.

\begin{mylemma}\label{indepkleisli}
 Let $\mD$ be a cartesian monoidal category, and let $T$ be a commutative monad on $\mD$.
 A Kleisli morphism $f^\sharp:A\to T(X_1\times\dots\times X_n)$ exhibits conditional independence of the $X_i$ given $A$ if and only if it factors as follows
 \[
 \begin{tikzcd}
  A \ar{d}[swap]{(g_1^\sharp,\dots,g_n^\sharp)} \ar{dr}{f^\sharp} \\
  TX_1\times\dots\times TX_n \ar{r}[swap]{c} & T(X_1\times\dots\times X_n) ,
 \end{tikzcd}
 \]
 for some Kleisli maps $g_i^\sharp:A\to TX_i$,
 where the map $c$ above is the one obtained by iterating the multiplication of the monoidal structure (such a map is unique by associativity). 
\end{mylemma}
\begin{proof}
 In terms of the base category $\mD$, a Kleisli morphism in the form of \Cref{defcondind} reads as follows.
 \[
  \begin{tikzcd}[sep=large]
   A \ar{r}{\mathrm{copy}} & A\times\dots\times A \ar{r}{g_1^\sharp\times\dots\times g_n^\sharp} & TX_1\times\dots\times TX_n \ar{r}{c} & T(X_1\times\dots\times X_n) .
  \end{tikzcd}
 \]
 Therefore $f^\sharp:A\to T(X_1\times\dots\times X_n)$ is exhibiting conditional independence if and only if it is in the form above.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Main result}


\begin{mydefinition}
 Let $\mC$ be a GS-category. We say that $\mC$ satisfies the \emph{localized independence property} if whenever a morphism 
 $f:A\to X\otimes Y\otimes Z$ exhibits conditional independence of $X\otimes Y$ (jointly) and $Z$ given $A$, as well as conditional independence of $X$ and $Y\otimes Z$ given $A$, then it exhibits conditional independence of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ given $A$. 
\end{mydefinition}


\begin{mytheorem}
 Let $\mD$ be a cartesian monoidal category, and let $T$ be a commutative monad on $\mD$.
 The following conditions are equivalent.
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{condgroup} $T$ is weakly affine;
  \item\label{condwm} $\mathrm{Kl}(T)$ is weakly Markov;
  \item\label{condlocal} $\mathrm{Kl}(T)$ satisfies the localized independence property;
  \item\label{condpullback} For all objects $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, the following associativity diagram is a pullback.
	\begin{equation}
		\label{assoc_pullback}
		\hspace{-9pt}	% T: for centering the equation number
		\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=3.3pc]
			T(X) \times T(Y) \times T(Z) \ar{r}{\id \times c_{Y,Z}} \ar[swap]{d}{c_{X,Y} \times \id}	& T(X) \times T(Y \times Z) \ar{d}{c_{X,Y \times Z}}	\\
			T(X \times Y) \times T(Z) \ar{r}{c_{X\times Y,Z}}						& T(X \times Y \times Z)
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation}
 \end{enumerate}
\end{mytheorem}

\begin{proof}
 $\ref{condgroup}\Leftrightarrow\ref{condwm}$: 
 see \Cref{weaklyboth}.
 
 $\ref{condwm}\Rightarrow\ref{condlocal}$: 
 Suppose $f:A\to X\otimes Y\otimes Z$ exhibits conditional independence of $X\otimes Y$ (jointly) and $Z$ given $A$, as well as conditional independence of $X$ and $Y\otimes Z$ given $A$
 By marginalizing out $X$, we have that $f_{YZ}$ exhibits conditional independence of $Y$ and $Z$ given $A$. 
 Since by hypothesis $f$ exhibits conditional independence of $X$ and $Y\otimes Z$ given $A$, by \Cref{eqcondind} we have that $f$ is equivalent to the product  of $f_X$ and $f_{YZ}$. But, again by \Cref{eqcondind}, $f_{YZ}$ is equivalent to the product of $f_Y$ and $f_Z$, so we have that $f$ is equivalent to the product of all its marginals. Using \Cref{eqcondind} in the other direction, thie means that $f$ exhibits conditional independence of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ given $A$. 
 
 $\ref{condlocal}\Rightarrow\ref{condpullback}$: 
 By the universal property of products, a cone over the cospan in \eqref{assoc_pullback} consists of maps $g_1^\sharp:A\to TX$, $g_{23}^\sharp:A\to T(Y\times Z)$, $g_{12}^\sharp:A\to T(X\times Y)$ and $g_3^\sharp:A\to TZ$ such that the following diagram commutes. 
 \[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=3.3pc]
   A \ar[bend left=10]{drr}{(g_1^\sharp,g_{23}^\sharp)} \ar[bend right=15]{ddr}[swap]{(g_{12}^\sharp,g_3^\sharp)} \\
   & T(X) \times T(Y) \times T(Z) \ar{r}[swap]{\id \times c_{Y,Z}} \ar{d}{c_{X,Y} \times \id}	& T(X) \times T(Y \times Z) \ar{d}{c_{X,Y \times Z}}	\\
   & T(X \times Y) \times T(Z) \ar{r}[swap]{c_{X\times Y,Z}}						& T(X \times Y \times Z)
  \end{tikzcd}
 \]
 By \Cref{indepkleisli}, this amounts to a Kleisli map $f^\sharp:A\to T(X\times Y\times Z)$ exhibiting conditional independence of $X$ and $Y\otimes Z$ given $A$, as well as of $X\otimes Y$ and $Z$ given $A$. By the localized independence property, we then have that $f$ exhibits conditional independence of all $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ given $A$, and so, again by \Cref{indepkleisli}, $f^\sharp$ factors through the product $TX\times TY\times TZ$. 
 More specifically, by marginalizing over $Z$, we have that $g_{12}^\sharp$ factors through $TX\times TY$, i.e.~the following diagram on the left commutes for some $h_1^\sharp:A\to TX$ and $h_2^\sharp:A\to TY$, and similarly, by marginalizing over $X$, the diagram on the right commutes for some $\ell_2^\sharp:A\to TY$ and $\ell_3^\sharp:A\to TZ$.
 \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
   A \ar{d}[swap]{(h_1^\sharp,h_2^\sharp)} \ar{dr}{g_{12}^\sharp} \\
   TX\times TY \ar{r}[swap]{c} & T(X\times Y) 
  \end{tikzcd}
  \qquad
  \begin{tikzcd}
   A \ar{d}[swap]{(\ell_2^\sharp,\ell_3^\sharp)} \ar{dr}{g_{23}^\sharp} \\
   TY\times TZ \ar{r}[swap]{c} & T(Y\times Z) 
  \end{tikzcd}
 \]
 In other words, the upper and the left curved triangles in the following diagram commute.
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=3.3pc]
   A \ar[bend left=15, shift left]{drr}{(g_1^\sharp,g_{23}^\sharp)} \ar[bend right=35]{ddr}[swap]{(g_{12}^\sharp,g_3^\sharp)} 
    \ar[shift left]{dr}[near end]{(g_1^\sharp,\ell_2^\sharp,\ell_3^\sharp)} \ar[shift right]{dr}[swap, pos=0.7]{(h_1^\sharp,h_2^\sharp, g_3^\sharp)} \\
   & T(X) \times T(Y) \times T(Z) \ar{r}[swap]{\id \times c_{Y,Z}} \ar{d}{c_{X,Y} \times \id}	& T(X) \times T(Y \times Z) \ar{d}{c_{X,Y \times Z}}	\\
   & T(X \times Y) \times T(Z) \ar{r}[swap]{c_{X\times Y,Z}}						& T(X \times Y \times Z)
  \end{tikzcd}
 \]
 By marginalizing over $Y$ and $Z$, there exists a unique $a^\sharp:A\to T1$ such that $h_1 = a\cdot g_1$. 
 Therefore
 \[
  g_{12} = h_1\cdot h_2 = (a\cdot g_1) \cdot h_2 = g_1\cdot (a\cdot h_2) ,
 \]
 and so in the diagram above we can equivalently replace $h_1$ and $h_2$ with $g_1$ and $a\cdot h_2$.
 Similarly by marginalizing over $X$ and $Y$, there exists a unique $c^\sharp:A\to T1$ such that $\ell_3=c\cdot g_3$, so that
 \[
  g_{23}= \ell_2\cdot\ell_3 = \ell_2\cdot (c\cdot g_3) = (c\cdot \ell_2) \cdot g_3
 \]
 and in the diagram above we can replace $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$ with $c\cdot \ell_2$ and $g_3$, as follows.
 \[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=3.3pc]
   A \ar[bend left=15, shift left]{drrr}{(g_1^\sharp,g_{23}^\sharp)} \ar[bend right=35]{ddrr}[swap]{(g_{12}^\sharp,g_3^\sharp)} 
    \ar[shift left]{drr}[near end]{(g_1^\sharp,(c\cdot\ell_2)^\sharp,g_3^\sharp)} \ar[shift right]{drr}[swap, pos=0.8]{(g_1^\sharp,(a\cdot h_2)^\sharp, g_3^\sharp)} \\
   && T(X) \times T(Y) \times T(Z) \ar{r}[swap]{\id \times c_{Y,Z}} \ar{d}{c_{X,Y} \times \id}	& T(X) \times T(Y \times Z) \ar{d}{c_{X,Y \times Z}}	\\
   && T(X \times Y) \times T(Z) \ar{r}[swap]{c_{X\times Y,Z}}						& T(X \times Y \times Z)
  \end{tikzcd}
 \]
 Now, marginalizing over $Z$ and $Z$, we see that necessarily $a\cdot h_2=c\cdot \ell_2$. 
 Therefore there is a unique map $A\to TX\times TY\times TZ$ making the whole diagram commute, which means that \eqref{assoc_pullback} is a pullback.
 
 $\ref{condpullback}\Rightarrow\ref{condgroup}$:
 If $T$ is weakly affine, then taking $X = Y = Z = 1$ in~\eqref{assoc_pullback} shows that this monoid must be an abelian group: we obtain a unique arrow $\freccia{T(1)}{\iota}{T(1)}$ making the following diagram commute,
	\[
		\begin{tikzcd}
			T1 \ar{dr}[description]{(\id,\iota,\id)} \ar[bend left=15]{drr}{(\id,\eta_1 !)} \ar[bend right,swap]{ddr}{(\eta_1 !,\id)} \\
			&	T1 \times T1 \times T1 \ar{r}{\id \times c_{1,1}} \ar[swap]{d}{c_{1,1} \times \id}	& T1 \times T(1\times 1) \ar{d}{c_{1,1\times 1}} \ar{r}{\cong} & T1\times T1 \ar{d}{c_{1,1}}	\\
			&	T(1\times 1) \times T1 \ar{r}{c_{1\times 1,1}} \ar{d}[swap]{\cong}	& T(1\times 1\times 1) \ar{d}{\cong} \ar{r}{\cong} & T(1\times 1) \ar{d}{\cong} \\
			& T1\times T1 \ar{r}[swap]{c_{1,1}} & T(1\times 1) \ar{r}[swap]{\cong} & T1
		\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	and the commutativity shows that $\iota$ satisfies the equations making it the inversion map for a group structure.
\end{proof}

\begin{myproposition}\label{prop:actio_group_as_pullback}
 Let $(G,\cdot,1)$ be a group and let $X$ be a set. A function $\alpha: M\times X\to X$ determines a left action if and only if the square
 \begin{equation}\label{action}
  \begin{tikzcd}
   G \times G \times X \ar{d}{\id\times\alpha} \ar{r}{\cdot\times\id} & M\times X \ar{d}{\alpha} \\
   G\times X \ar{r}{\alpha} & X
  \end{tikzcd}
 \end{equation}
 commutes and it is a pullback.
\end{myproposition}
\begin{proof}
By definition, the square \eqref{action} commutes if and only if $\alpha$ and $\cdot$ are compatible. Now we show that the commutative square \eqref{action} is a pullback if and only if $\alpha$ satisfies the identity axiom, i.e. $\alpha(e,x)=x$ for every $x$ in $X$.
Now, if \eqref{action} is a pullback, then there exists a function $\beta:X\to G$ such that the diagram

commutes, where $e!:X\to G$ is the function assigning the identity element $e$ to every element $x$ of $X$. Now, since the left triangle commutes, then we have that $e=e\cdot \beta (x)$ for every $x$ of $X$, i.e. $\beta(x)=e$ for every $x$ of $X$. Now, since the right triangle commutes, we can conclude that $\alpha (\beta(x),x)=\alpha (e,x)=x$ for every $x$ in $X$. 

Now we show that $\alpha (e,x)=x$ implies that  the commutative square \eqref{action} is a pullback. Let us consider a set $Y$ and the functions $\angbr{f_1}{f_2}:Y\to G\times X$ and  $\angbr{g_1}{g_2}:Y\to G\times X$ such that $\alpha( f_1(y),f_2(y))=\alpha( g_1(y),g_2(y))$. By applying $\alpha (f_1(y)^{-1},-)$ to both sides, and then combining the compatibility of $\alpha$ with the assumption that $\alpha (e,x)=x$, we can conclude that $f_2(y)=\alpha (f_1(y)^{-1}\cdot g_1(y),g_2(y))$.
%similarly, that $g_2(y)=\alpha (g_1(y)^{-1}\cdot f_1(y),f_2(y))$. 
Therefore, we can conclude that the diagram

commutes, where the function $\gamma: Y \to M$ is defined by $\gamma (y):= f_1^{-1}(y)\cdot g_1 (y)$. By the unicity of the inverse in a group, this function is also unique, and hence we can conclude that the commutative square \eqref{action} is a pullback.
\end{proof}


\begin{myproposition}
	\label{lem:group_action}
	If $T$ is weakly affine, then for every object $X$, the morphism $c_{1,X}: T(1)\times T(X)\to T(X)$ determines a (left) group action. 

\end{myproposition}
\begin{proof}
%Let $\freccia{T(X)}{\gamma}{T(X)}$ be the unique morphism such that the diagram
%	\[
%		\begin{tikzcd}
%			T(X) \ar{dr}[description]{(\eta_1!,\gamma,\eta_1!)} \ar[bend left]{drr}{(\eta_1!,\id)} \ar[bend right,swap]{ddr}{(\id,\eta_1!)} \\

%			&	T(X) \times T(1) \ar{r}{c_{X,1}}								& T(X)
%		\end{tikzcd}
%	\]
%	commutes. Now we show that the morphism $c_{1,X}\circ (\id_{T1}\times \gamma): T(1)\times T(X)\to T(X)$ provides an action of the group $T(1)$ on $T(X)$. First, notice that identity axiom, i.e. $(c_{1,X} (\id_{T1}\times \gamma))(\eta_1!, \id)=\id$, is satisfied by definition of $\gamma$, because $c_{1,X}(\eta_1!,\gamma)=\id$. 
	The compatibility axiom follows from the fact that the diagram

commutes for every strong and commutative monad. Moreover, following the same proof used for \Cref{prop:actio_group_as_pullback}, we can conclude that the identity axiom is satisfied since $T$ is weakly affine. In particular, because $T(1)$ is a group by \Cref{lem_T1_group}, and the previous square is a pullbackc (by definition of weakly affine monad).
\end{proof}

\end{tikzcd}\]
commutes, then $T^2(1)\cong T(1)$ in $\mA$. 

\end{myproposition}
\begin{proof}
	To prove the result it is enough to show that $T(1)\cong 1$ in the Kleisli category $\mA_T$.
We know from Lemma~\label{lem:T1_group} that $T(1)$ is a group in $\mA$, where the arrow $\freccia{1}{\eta_1}{T(1)}$ is the unit of the group, and $\freccia{T(1)}{\iota}{T(1)}$ is the inversion map. Therefore, we have that the composition $\freccia{1}{\iota\eta_1}{T(1)}$ has to be equal to $\eta_1$. Therefore, we can consider the arrows $1\to T(1)$ and $T(1)\to 1$ in the Kleisli category $\mA_T$ given by $T(\eta_1)\eta_1$ and $\iota$ respectively. The composition $T(\eta_1)\eta_1$ with $\iota$ in $\mA_T$ is given by $\mu_{1,1}T(\iota)T(\eta_1)\eta_1$. Employing the naturality of $\eta_1$ and the fact that $\iota\eta_1=\eta_1$, it is direct to check that $\mu T(\iota)T(\eta_1)\eta_1=\eta_1$, that is the identity $1\to 1$ in $\mA_T$. Now to show that the other composition gives the identity on $T(1)$ in $\mA_T$, it is enough to show that $T(\eta_1)\iota=\eta_{T(1)}$, but this follows by hypothesis.
\end{proof}
\todo[inline]{(Paolo) Credo che $T(\eta_1)\iota\ne\eta_{T(1)}$ nell'esempio delle misure nonzero. Per ogni $x$ in $(0,\infty)=T1$ abbiamo che $\eta_{T(1)}(x)=\delta_x$ (delta di Dirac), mentre $T\eta_1(\iota(x)) = T\eta_1(1/x) = 1/x\,\delta_1$.}

	commutes, then $T(1)$ is an idempotent group, namely $\iota=\id_{T1}$.
\end{mycorollary}
\begin{proof}
By \Cref{lem_T1_group} we have that $T(1)$ is a group. If $\eta_{T1}=T(\eta_{1})\iota$, then  we can apply the multiplication of the monad to both sides, obtaining $\iota=\id_{T1}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{myremark}
 Bart Jacobs calls a strong monad $T$ on a cartesian monoidal category \emph{strongly affine}~\cite{Jacobs16} if for every pair of objects $X$ and $Y$, the following diagram is a pullback,
 \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
   X \times TY \ar{d}{\pi_1} \ar{r}{s} & T(X\times Y) \ar{d}{T\pi_1} \\
   X \ar{r}{\eta} & TX
  \end{tikzcd}
 \]
where $s$ denotes the strength and $\eta$ denotes the unit of the monad. Every strongly affine monad is affine. 
The corresponding condition on the (Markov) category $\mathrm{Kl}(T)$ is called \emph{positivity}~\cite[Section~2]{fritz2022dilations}.

Note that for a generic commutative monad, the diagram above may even fail to commute (take for example the measure monad $M$, and start with $(x,0)$ in the bottom left corner). One can however consider the following new diagram, which reduces to the one above (up to isomorphism) in the affine case,
\[
 \begin{tikzcd}
   X \times TY \ar{d}{\id\times T!} \ar{r}{s} & T(X\times Y) \ar{d}{T(\id\times!)} \\
   X \times T1 \ar{r}{s} & T(X\times 1) \cong TX
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
and which always commutes by naturality of the strengh. One can then call the monad $T$ \emph{positive} if this second diagram is a pullback (and possibly define \emph{positive GS categories} analogously to positive Markov categories). 
All the examples of weakly affine monads that we have are positive in this sense, so one may wonder if every weakly affine monad is positive. 
\end{myremark}




\appendix

\section{Yoneda embedding intepretation of \Cref{weaklyboth}}\label{yoneda}

We can interpret \Cref{weaklyboth} more abstractly in terms of presheaves.
Let $\mD$ be a cartesian monoidal category.
Consider the presheaf category $[\mD^\mathrm{op},\Set]$, equipped with the Day convolution product,
\[
 F\boxtimes G \cong \int^{A,B\in\mD} \mD(-, A\times B) \times F(A) \times G(B) .
\]
The Yoneda embedding $\mD\to [\mD^\mathrm{op},\Set]$ is strong monoidal: indeed, for each $X$,
\[
 1 \cong \mD(X,1) ,
\]
since $1$ is terminal, and for each $X$ and $Y$, by Yoneda reduction,
\begin{align*}
 \mD(-,X) \boxtimes \mD(-,Y) &\cong \int^{A,B\in\mD} \mD(-, A\times B) \times \mD(-,X) \times \mD(-,Y) \\
  &\cong \mD(-, X\times Y) .
\end{align*}
Therefore, and by the universal property of products, at the level of individual hom-sets the Day convolution product of representable presheaves just takes the cartesian products of sets: 
\[
 \big(\mD(-,X) \boxtimes \mD(-,Y)\big)(A) \cong  \mD(A, X\times Y) \cong \mD(A,X) \times \mD(A,Y) .
\]
Take now an object $M$ of $\mD$. Since the Yoneda embedding is fully faithful and strong monoidal, a monoid structure $(M,m,e)$ on $M$ is equivalently a monoid structure on the representable presheaf $\mD(-,M)$. 
This makes the individual hom-sets monoids, with unit and multiplication as follows for each object $X$:
\[
 \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=tiny]
  1 \ar{r}{\cong} & \mD(X,1) \ar{r}{e_*} & \mD(X,M) \\
  \mD(X,M) \times \mD(X,M) \ar{r}{\cong} & \mD(X,M\times M) \ar{r}{m_*} & \mD(X,M) 
 \end{tikzcd}
\]
This is precisely the monoid structure that we have defined in \Cref{monoids} for $M=T1$. 

\begin{myproposition}
 $M$ is an internal group if and only if all the monoids $\mD(X,M)$ are groups.
\end{myproposition}
\begin{proof}
 By \Cref{assoc_group}, $M$ is a group object if and only if its associativity square \eqref{assoc} is a pullback. Since the hom-functor preserves and reflects all limits in its second argument, we have that \eqref{assoc} is a pullback if and only if for each object $X$, the following diagram (or equivalently, its bottom right square) is a pullback,
 \[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small]
  \mD(X,M) \times \mD(X,M) \times \mD(X,M) \ar{dr}[swap]{\cong} \ar{dd} \ar{rr} && \mD(X,M) \times \mD(X,M) \ar{d}{\cong} \\
  & \mD(X,M\times M\times M) \ar{r}[swap]{(m\times\id)_*} \ar{d}{(\id\times m)_*} & \mD(X,M\times M) \ar{d}{m_*} \\
  \mD(X,M) \times \mD(X,M) \ar{r}[swap]{\cong} & \mD(X,M\times M) \ar{r}[swap]{m_*} & \mD(X,M)
  \end{tikzcd}
 \]
 where the unlabelled arrows are the unique ones that make the diagram commute.
 Again by \Cref{assoc_group}, the diagram above is a pullback if and only if $\mD(X,M)$ is a group.
\end{proof}



\end{document}
